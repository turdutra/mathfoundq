Bachelor in Physics (2018) and Master in Physics (2021) by Universidade Federal de Uberlândia (Uberlândia, Brazil), studying the general subject of Quantum Information Theory and, in particular, trying to find the best conditions to produce highly entangled states using charge qubits (by the way, only in a simulation sense). Currently, PhD student at Universidade Estadual de Campinas, on the matter of Foundations of Quantum Theory and, once again, in particular, using the exclusivity graph approach to study contextuality.
