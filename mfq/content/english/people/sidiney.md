PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at the University of Campinas, MSc in Mathematics and BSc in Physics at the State University of Maringá. During my undergraduate I focused on the study of classical field theory, Lie groups and Lie algebras. My master’s dealt with the mathematics of conformal transformations, quantization and applications in theoretical physics. In my PhD, I’m focusing on the foundations of quantum theory, specifically the phenomenon of contextuality, its geometrical and topological manifestations, and applications in quantum information, quantum resources, and foundations of physics.
