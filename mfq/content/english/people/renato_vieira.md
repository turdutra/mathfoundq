I have an undergrad, masters and Ph.D. degrees in mathematics by University of São Paulo. I have completed a postdoctoral fellowship at University of São Paulo, and currently I am a postdoctoral researcher at State University of Campinas. My areas of interest include algebraic topology, non-abelian topology, category theory, homotopy theory, stable homotopy theory, model category theory, operad theory, K-theory and mathematical physics. My current research focuses on the representation of multiplicative (co)homology theories by ring spectra, in particular in the construction of ring spectra that represent topological and operator K-theories. I am also interested in the application of operator K-theory in condensed matter physics, in particular in the classification of fermionic systems with symmetries.
