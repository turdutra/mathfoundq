I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from the São Carlos Institute of Physics at the University of São Paulo (IFSC-USP). Following my undergraduate studies, I earned a Master of Science in Applied Mathematics from the Institute of Mathematics, Statistics, and Scientific Computing at the State University of Campinas (IMECC-UNICAMP). Presently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at the same institute. My main interest is KS-contextuality.
