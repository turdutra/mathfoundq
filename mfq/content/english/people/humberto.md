I am a researcher at the State University of Campinas working in quantum information theory, and a member of the Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Theory group (MFQ). I obtained my PhD from the State University of Campinas (Unicamp) and a postdoc at the University of Hong Kong as a member of the Quantum Information and Computation Initiative group (QICI).

I am interested in the foundations of quantum mechanics, especially in Bell nonlocality and (device-independent) communication and processing protocols.
